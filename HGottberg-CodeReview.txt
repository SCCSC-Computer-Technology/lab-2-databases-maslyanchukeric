Heinrich Gottberg Code Review of Eric Maslyanchuk Lab 2

Is the code generally readable and well-documented?

	Yes, the code is well organized and very legible. I can tell what's going on in every block.
	Your numbers were formatted which is a plus.

Did you find any software defects?

	No, the program ran as expected. The labels however, weren't cleared on load so they still say
	label1. This is a quick fix though.

What was one way that their solution differed from yours?

	You included separate buttons to add to the database, while I just used the built in controls
	that are part of importing a database.

Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?

	I think making the database bigger would be nice so the user can see more.

This code is very clean! It was super easy to tell what everything did and wasn't hard to find anything. All the requirements were met. Good job.
